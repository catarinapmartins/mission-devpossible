# üöÄ Mission: DevPossible

"Making on-premise development faster, smoother, and (slightly) less painful!"

This repository is the command center for transforming Swissgrid‚Äôs on-premise development environment. It presents a prioritized action plan to address the key challenges described by the developers.

## Critical Issues 

  - Slow and Restrictive Software Approval Process
    
  - Slow Development Machines
    
  - Frequent Software Failures
    
  - Lack of Software Ownership

## Action Plan & Prioritized Solutions

The action plan is divided into 3 phases: short-term, mid-term and long-term. The distribution of solutions in the different phases considers a balance between the impact on users and implementation time.


### Phase 1: Short-term actions

  #### Improve Software Approval Process
  
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Automate approval workflows where possible
      - Introduce a pre-approved software list to eliminate repetitive approvals.
      - Create roles for teams/projects with specific authorizations (as done in R&D).
    - Rethink approval workflow
      - Send to direct manager to confirm project needs.
      - Forward to relevant tech department which understands developer needs.
    
    Expected Outcome: 
    
    - Reduced waiting time for approvals ‚Üí improved developer satisfaction
    - Reduction is administrative tasks for department leads
    
  
  #### Improve Development Machines
  
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Upgrade development machines for frequent developers (16GB RAM, SSDs, better CPUs).
    - Re-assess "heavy" softwares that are making the machines slow.
    - Divide developers according to usage and adapt current environment to different groups.
    
    Expected Outcome:
    
    - Better performance ‚Üí Faster machines, fewer delays.


### Phase 2: Mid-term actions 

  #### Improve Software Testing & Accountability
  
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Define clear ownership, ensuring each software owner commits to testing updates 
    before deployment (‚ÄúNo Untested Updates‚Äù policy).
    - Introduce a mandatory staging environment to test software updates before deployment.
    - Ensure bought/outsourced software is delivered with proper documentation.
    
    Expected Outcome:
    
    - Increased accountability ‚Üí Software Owners take responsibility for their products.
    - More stability ‚Üí Software failures decrease with enforced testing.
  
  #### Promote On-Cloud Environment
    
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Start assessing which projects/developers can move to the cloud environment.
    
    Expected Outcome:
    
    - Users become more aware of cloud computing possibilites


### Phase 3: Long-term actions

  #### Improve On-Premise Development Practises
  
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Introduce automated testing as part of the CI/CD process.
    - Guidelines for development & testing.
    - Establish clear guidelines for on-premise vs. cloud environments use
    
    Expected Outcome:
    
    - Improved developer experience
    
  #### Move Selected Projects to Cloud Environment
    
    Proposed Solutions:
    
    - Transition projects into the Data Platform according to "Use-Case Squad" availability
    
    Expected Outcome:
    
    - Greater cloud adoption ‚Üí Reduced reliance on restrictive on-premise environments.
  
  
## Next steps

* Discuss action plan with management team
* Discuss proposed solutions with technical/implementation team
* Set clear milestones and KPIs for each solution
* Implement changes incrementally, starting with quick wins (Phase 1)
* Regularly gather feedback from developers and iterate on solutions
* Provide training and documentation for new processes and tools
