# ðŸš€ Mission: DevPossible
"Making on-prem development faster, smoother, and (slightly) less painful!"

This repository is the command center for transforming Swissgridâ€™s on-premises development environment. From streamlining approvals to boosting machine performance, we're tackling the biggest dev headaches with practical solutions. 


## Critical Issues / Key Challenges

- Permissions
- Slow machines
- Software Failures
- Lack of software ownership

## Prioritized Solutions

### Phase 1

- Improve permissions -> create baseline
- Create IAM profiles (as we did in R&D)

### Phase 2

- Assess getting bigger machines? for certain developers? check if having different sized machines makes sense
- improve testing of softwares
- Incentivize moving to cloud whenever possible

### Phase 3

-

## Expected Outcome

- Faster approvals â†’ Reduced waiting times, improved developer satisfaction.
- Better performance â†’ Faster machines, fewer delays.
- More stability â†’ Software failures decrease with enforced testing.
- Increased accountability â†’ Software Owners take responsibility for their products.
- Greater cloud adoption â†’ Reduced reliance on restrictive on-prem environments.
